        <h2>Disability in Psychology Training: Where are we?</h2>

        <p>
        Written by Erin E. Andrews and Emily L. Lund. Published by the Journal of Training and Education in 
        Professional Psychology.
        This is a journal article where Andrews is a professor of psychology and Lund is the assistant professor
        of counseling education and rehabilitation counseling.
        Disabled people make up the largest marginalized group in the United States, yet there is a concerning 
        lack of disabled psychologists and trainees. Disabled people tend to be underrepresented in psychology, 
        as well as professional careers as a whole.

        <h2>The Social Identity Approach to Disability: Bridging Disability Studies and Psychological Science</h2>

        <p>
          Written by Thomas P. Dirth and Nyla R. Branscombe. Published by the Psychological Bulletin
          This is a journal article where both authors are professors of psychology. 
          The traditional approach to integrating psychology and disability studies has proven to be ineffective. 
          The use of a new approach, the social approach, aims to encompass social, cultural, political, and 
          historical features that have been lacking in the traditional approach; this would aid in finding a critical 
          comprehension of disability studies.

        <h2>Towards a Psychology of Disability: The emotional effects of living in a disabling society</h2>

        <p>
          Written by Donna Reeve. Published by the Journal of Disability and Psychology.
          This is a journal article where the author explores the creative intersections of disability
          studies and counselling.
          Having a disability can affect someone emotionally whether that be in the workplace, or at home. 
          Psychology and disability need to join together to remove the “disabling barrier” which is created 
          by viewing disability as a “deficit”.
